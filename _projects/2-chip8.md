This is a personal project I worked on to create a [CHIP8](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CHIP-8) emulator using C++ and SDL2, which is based off of an adapted version of an early prototype I previously built in C.

The project required learning skills and technologies new to me at the time, such as:
- Reading technical documentation and references, and extracting necessary information
- Understanding low-level computer architecture (e.g. Memory maps, Registers, Clock Cycles/Timers etc)
- Simulating a CPU in software (software emulation)
- C++ modular project structure
- Creating a GUI 
- Working with Binary and Hexadecimal information (e.g. File I/O, Assemblers, etc).

The code can be found at: [https://github.com/aaxbas/CHIP8](https://github.com/aaxbas/CHIP8)

I have also made a port to the system intended for embedded systems such as an Arduino. This helped me improve the design of my modular structure, and verified my initial ideas.
