The IMechE UAS Challenge is an annual competition for the design and development of unmanned aerial systems (UAS). I worked on developing the computer vision, communications and navigation subsystems. This has given me a lot of experience in embedded systems and linux development, as well as radio communications.

### Tasks
* Used OpenCV, python and tesseract OCR to design and develop a computer vision solution required to detect specific targets from a drone as part of a multi-discipline team.
* Utilized the MAVLink communication protocol, hardware (UART) and software (bit-banging) serial to send commands to and from a Pixhawk flight controller and two Raspberry Pi 3 computers.

In 2019, I was elected as Contol Team Leader where I:
* Led a team of multi-disciplinary engineers in designing and developing the control system used in an autonomous aircraft to compete in the IMechE UAS Challenge.
* Expanded upon previous yearâ€™s control system design, including updating hardware to match modern standards and re-writing code to increase efficiency.
* Oversaw the development of a new computer vision program in C++ and OpenCV to improve target detection speed.
* Designed an antenna tracking system with a custom PCB that increased the range of the communication system to 20 KM.
