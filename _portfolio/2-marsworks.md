The European Rover Challenge (ERC) is an international, annual space robotics competition held in Poland. 
The aim of the challenge is to create an autonomous rover that can do various tasks in a Mars-like environment. 
I participated in the 2020 competition as part of MarsWorks, a team from the University of Sheffield, and am currently participating in the 2021 competition as well.

## Tasks
* Worked within a multidisciplinary team of engineers to build an autonomous rover to take part in the European Rover Challenge (ERC).
* Developed a ROS system to handle sub-system and radio communication and operation of the rover remotely.
* Designed a system to control a robotic arm accurately and efficiently using inverse kinematics.
